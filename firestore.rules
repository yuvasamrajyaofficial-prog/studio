/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user data,
 * ensuring users can only access their own information. Scripture data is treated as public content,
 * readable by anyone. Project data is private to the user who created it.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into three primary top-level collections:
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data. Access is strictly controlled
 *     based on the authenticated user's ID matching the document ID.
 *   - /scriptures/{scriptureId}: Stores public scripture information, accessible to all clients.
 *   - /projects/{projectId}: Stores private user-generated project data, accessible only by the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *   - User Data Privacy: A user can only create, read, update, or delete their own document
 *     within the /users collection.
 *   - User Listing Disabled: To prevent user enumeration and protect privacy, listing
 *     documents in the /users collection is explicitly forbidden.
 *   - Project Data Privacy: Users can only create projects for themselves and can only access
 *     projects they own. Listing the entire 'projects' collection is forbidden.
 *   - Public Read-Only Content: The /scriptures collection is publicly readable by anyone,
 *     including unauthenticated users, to facilitate content discovery.
 *   - Secure-by-Default Writes: Writes to the /scriptures collection are currently disabled
 *     because the 'Scripture' entity is missing an 'authorId' or 'ownerId' field. This
 *     prevents anonymous or unauthorized content creation and is a placeholder for a future
 *     role-based or ownership-based write rule.
 *   - Immutable Fields: Critical user fields like `id`, `role`, and `kycStatus` are
 *     made immutable on update to prevent users from altering their own ID or escalating
 *     their privileges.
