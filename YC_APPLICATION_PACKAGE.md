## 🔥 The Problem

| Problem                               | Scale                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| People feel lost and overwhelmed      | 1 in 4 adults report feeling anxious weekly                              |
| Therapy is expensive and inaccessible | $150/session, 3-month waitlists                                          |
| Meditation apps are generic           | 95% churn after 30 days                                                  |
| Ancient wisdom is locked in texts     | 99% of humanity can't read Sanskrit, Classical Chinese, or Ancient Greek |
| Current AI is smart but soulless      | ChatGPT can code, but can't help you find meaning                        |
