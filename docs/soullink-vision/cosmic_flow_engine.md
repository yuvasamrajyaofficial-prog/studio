# "Cosmic Flow" 3D Engine: Features & Controls

## Concept

A real-time, interactive 3D universe (built with Three.js/Flutter) that visualizes the user's place in the cosmos. It's not just a map; it's a "Living Kalacakra" (Wheel of Time).

## Key Features

1.  **Personalized Star Map:**
    - Visualizes the user's birth chart in 3D space.
    - Shows current planetary transits (Gochara) relative to their natal positions.
2.  **The Yuga Timeline:**
    - A zoomable timeline showing the 4 Yugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali).
    - Users can "fly" through history to see when major scriptures were revealed.
3.  **Energy Visualization (Chakras/Nadis):**
    - A 3D human model that glows based on the user's current **Soul ID** and **Karmic Analytics**.
    - Visualizes the flow of Prana during meditation sessions.

## Controls & Interaction

- **Orbit/Pan:** Explore the celestial sphere.
- **Time Travel:** Slider to see past or future planetary alignments.
- **Deep Dive:** Tap on a planet or star to see its astrological significance and related scriptures.
- **Haptic Feedback:** Subtle vibrations when "crossing" significant cosmic boundaries.

## Technical Integration

- **Data Source:** Swiss Ephemeris API for precise planetary positions.
- **Rendering:** Optimized for mobile devices to ensure 60fps fluid motion.
- **Sync:** Real-time sync with the user's **Soul ID**.
