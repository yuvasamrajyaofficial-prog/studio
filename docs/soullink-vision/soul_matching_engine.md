# Astrology & Soul Matching Engine

## Concept

The engine that powers the "Soul Signature" matching. It goes beyond "Sun Signs" to look at deep karmic and psychological compatibility.

## The "Soul Signature" (SS)

The SS is a multi-dimensional vector:
`SS = [Moon_Nakshatra, Ascendant_Element, Guna_Balance, Core_Values, Spiritual_Goals]`

## Matching Logic

1.  **Karmic Resonance:** Matches users with complementary Nakshatras (based on traditional Vedic synastry/Ashta Kuta).
2.  **Growth Alignment:** Connects a "Sattvic" mentor with a "Rajasic" seeker.
3.  **Conflict Avoidance:** Uses "Corporate Soul-Matching" logic to warn about potential clashes in professional settings.

## Features

- **Soul Circles:** Automatically suggested groups based on shared SS.
- **Daily Cosmic Weather:** Personalized advice on who to collaborate with today based on transits.
- **Privacy First:** Users can choose what parts of their Soul Signature are visible to others.
