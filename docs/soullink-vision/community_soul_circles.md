# Community & "Soul Circles"

## Concept

A social layer that connects users based on spiritual depth and shared growth goals, rather than superficial metrics.

## Soul Circles

- **Dynamic Groups:** Automatically formed based on **Soul ID** compatibility.
- **Study Groups:** Dedicated circles for specific scriptures (e.g., "The Isha Upanishad Seekers").
- **Sadhana Challenges:** Collaborative meditation or chanting goals (e.g., "108 Days of Gayatri Mantra").

## Features

1.  **Karmic Gifting:** Users can gift "Karma Points" to others for helpful advice or support.
2.  **Wisdom Feed:** A curated feed of insights, dream interpretations (shared anonymously), and cosmic updates.
3.  **Expert Q&A:** Verified scholars and psychologists host live "Satsangs" (spiritual gatherings).

## Safety & Moderation

- **Sattvic Filter:** AI-powered moderation that flags aggressive or non-dharmic behavior.
- **Anonymity Options:** Users can participate in circles using their "Soul Avatar" to maintain privacy.
