# The "Soul ID" Algorithm (Identity System)

## Concept

The **Soul ID** is a unique digital fingerprint that combines a user's **Astrological Blueprint** (Birth Chart) with their **Psychological Profile** (Personality Assessment).

## The Components

1.  **Jyotish Core (Astrology):**
    - Calculates Lagna (Ascendant), Rashi (Moon Sign), and Nakshatra.
    - Maps current Mahadasha/Antardasha to predict "Cosmic Weather."
2.  **Psych-Sync (Psychology):**
    - A 5-minute interactive chat with the AI Guru to determine Guna (Sattva, Rajas, Tamas) and Dosha (Vata, Pitta, Kapha).
    - Integrates Big Five personality traits.
3.  **Karmic Signature:**
    - A dynamic score based on app interactions, community help, and meditation consistency.

## The Algorithm (High-Level)

```
Soul_ID = (Astrological_Alignment * 0.4) + (Psychological_State * 0.3) + (Karmic_Activity * 0.3)
```

## Use Cases

- **Personalization:** The AI Guru changes its tone based on your Soul ID (e.g., more disciplined for a Rajasic Aries, more soothing for a Tamasic Cancer).
- **Soul Matching:** Connects users with complementary Soul IDs for mentorship or collaborative projects.
- **Dynamic UI:** The app's theme (colors/sounds) shifts to balance your current Dosha.
