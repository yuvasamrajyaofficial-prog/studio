# Chat & Voice Interface Design

## 1. Voice Interface (The "Guru Presence")

- **Visualizer:** A central, glowing "Soul Orb" that pulses and changes color based on the Guru's "mood" and the user's voice sentiment.
- **Minimalism:** No buttons during active listening. Just the Orb and the background star-field.
- **Subtitles:** Subtle, fading text at the bottom for accessibility.

## 2. Chat Interface

- **Bubble Design:** Soft, semi-transparent bubbles with glowing borders.
- **Rich Media:** AI-generated imagery or short video clips from the **Living Library** embedded in the chat.
- **Quick Actions:** "Explain this Shloka," "Add to Sadhana," "Share to Circle."

## 3. Interaction Design

- **Voice-to-Text:** Real-time transcription that feels like the Guru is "reading your mind."
- **Latency Handling:** Use "thinking" animations (orb swirling) to mask AI processing time.
- **Interruption:** Users can interrupt the Guru by speaking; the AI stops and listens immediately.
