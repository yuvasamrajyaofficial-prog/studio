# AI Ethics & Crisis Intervention Protocols

## 1. Ethical Guardrails

- **Dharmic Alignment:** The AI is programmed to prioritize non-violence (Ahimsa), truth (Satya), and compassion (Karuna) in all responses.
- **Non-Judgmental Stance:** The Guru provides guidance without judging the user's past or current state.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Respecting the diversity of interpretations within the Hindu tradition and beyond.

## 2. Crisis Intervention (The "Safety Net")

- **Detection:** Real-time monitoring for keywords and vocal cues indicating self-harm, depression, or violence.
- **Immediate Response:**
  - "I hear that you are in deep pain. Please know that you are not alone, but as an AI, I cannot provide the medical help you need right now."
  - Automatic display of local emergency and suicide prevention hotlines.
- **Escalation:** Option for the user to be connected to a human counselor (available in Soul Pro).

## 3. Bias & Fairness

- Regular audits of AI responses to ensure they are free from gender, caste, or religious bias.
- Diverse training data including various schools of thought (Advaita, Vishishtadvaita, Dvaita, etc.).
