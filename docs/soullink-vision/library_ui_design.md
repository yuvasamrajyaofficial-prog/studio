# Library & Reading Experience UI

## 1. The Library Hub

- **Visual Tree:** A vertical, scrollable hierarchy of scriptures (as implemented in the current build).
- **Search:** "Omni-Search" that looks through titles, Shlokas, and AI-generated summaries.
- **Featured Section:** "Scripture of the Day" based on the user's current cosmic transits.

## 2. The Reading View

- **Flipbook Mode:** For a traditional feel, users can "flip" pages with realistic haptics and sound.
- **Focus Mode:** Removes all UI elements except the text and a subtle background glow.
- **Interactive Shlokas:** Tap any word for its etymology (Nirukta) and AI explanation.
- **Audio Integration:** Floating player for **Binaural Chanting** that stays active while reading.

## 3. Personalization

- **Reading Progress:** Visualized as a "Path to Awakening" on the scripture card.
- **Annotations:** Users can leave "Soul Notes" (private) or "Circle Notes" (shared with their group).
