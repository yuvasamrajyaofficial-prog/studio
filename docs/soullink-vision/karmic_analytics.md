# Karmic Analytics (Gamification)

## Concept

Moving beyond "Mood Tracking" to "Karma Tracking." A gamified system that rewards spiritual growth and altruism.

## The Karma Meter

- **Visual Representation:** A glowing orb on the user's profile that changes color and brightness.
- **Sattvic (White/Gold):** High points for meditation, helping others, and study.
- **Rajasic (Red/Orange):** Reflects high activity, ambition, and intense practice.
- **Tamasic (Dark/Heavy):** Indicates a need for rest or a shift in practice.

## Earning "Good Karma Points" (GKP)

1.  **Daily Sadhana:** Completing a meditation or chanting session (+10 GKP).
2.  **Wisdom Sharing:** Answering a question in a Soul Circle (+20 GKP).
3.  **Altruism:** Donating to a "Digital Puja" cause (+50 GKP).
4.  **Consistency:** 7-day streak (+100 GKP).

## Rewards

- **Soul Avatar Upgrades:** Unlock new 3D elements for your cosmic avatar.
