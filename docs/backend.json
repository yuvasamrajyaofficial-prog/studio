Scripture data is stored in a `scriptures` collection, facilitating easy querying and management of scripture entries. The 'projects' collection stores user-generated content with strict ownership rules. The 'voices' collection stores sensitive voice model data, with strict ownership and KYC-based creation rules. The 'appConfig' collection stores global settings that are publicly readable but not client-writable. This structure avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies, improving security rule simplicity and debuggability. It also supports robust `list` operations for scriptures, as all documents in the `scriptures` collection share the same security requirements.",
