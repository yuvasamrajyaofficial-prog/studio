# **App Name**: Cosmic Scriptures Explorer

## Core Features:

- Interactive Tree Navigation: Navigate through the scriptures by interacting with the tree visualization. Select different branches (Epics, Regional Texts, Philosophical Works) and eras (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali) to filter content.
- Scripture Category View: Display scriptures categorized under 'Ancient Scriptures', 'Regional Texts', and 'Philosophical Works'.
- Era Selection: Allow users to select a specific era (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali) to filter the scriptures displayed. A slider will provide a visual way of making the era selection.
- Contextual Scripture Summarization: Use a tool to provide a concise summary of each scripture based on the selected era and category. Generative AI is employed to provide appropriate context about any biases relevant to the category and era.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of mystery and cosmic depth.
- Background color: Very dark indigo (#1A0033), almost black, to simulate the night sky.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#FFD700) for highlights and interactive elements, reminiscent of ancient manuscripts.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, for an elegant, high-end feel in titles. Body text: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, for comfortable reading.
- Use subtle, glowing icons inspired by constellations to represent different scripture categories and eras.
- Maintain a clean, uncluttered layout with a central focus on the tree visualization.
- Subtle animations for tree transitions and content loading.
